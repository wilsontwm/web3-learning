# Web3 Authentication (Backend)

Built using [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/), this is a backend for Web3 authentication which uses MongoDB for data storage.

## Getting Started

Rename .realize.example.yaml to .realize.yaml and replace the environment variable accordingly.

Install [realize](https://github.com/oxequa/realize) if haven't.

To start the backend server,

```bash
realize start
```
