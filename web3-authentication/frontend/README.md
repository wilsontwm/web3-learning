# Web3 Authentication (Frontend)

Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), this is a frontend for Web3 authentication using Metamask, Coinbase Wallet and Wallet Connect.

It uses [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) package to connect to different wallets. There are more wallets than those listed above.

## Getting Started

To start the frontend server,

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Note that the frontend server has to run together with the backend server to complete the authentication process.
